  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>My name is Kyle Nolff and I am a senior at Oakland University. I am majoring in Information Technology with an
    emphasis in Cybersecurity. I am very excited to be graduating next year and I am looking forward to starting my
    career in the IT field. I am from Macomb, MI and have lived here most of my life. I'm a big Detriot Lions fan, even
    with their performance in the last couple of years. I currenly have no experience in the field, and I work at Jimmy
    Johns for the time being. I've had constant jobs since I was about 15 and have lots of experience with custoemr
    service. I would like to work in the cybersecuirty field once i graduate, and would love to get an internship
    beforehand to get some experience. If you wish to know more about me you can check out <a
